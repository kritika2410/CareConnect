# Careconnect

The project aims to address the needs of daycare centers and parents by offering features that make scheduling, attendance tracking, and communication processes more efficient. 

Our goal is to create an app that simplifies the daycare management process, benefiting parents by providing easy access to information and seamless communication with daycare centers. For daycare centers, the app will streamline administrative tasks, improve communication with parents, and enhance operational efficiency. Ultimately, we aim to foster better coordination and communication between parents and caregivers, ensuring a smooth and efficient childcare experience for all stakeholders involved.
